# StackVerse

## 1. Project Overview

StackVerse is a platform that allows gamers to Play, Earn, Organize & Stream Games on the **Stacks blockchain**. Our vision is to create an immersive, impartial, and inclusive ecosystem for web3 gamers worldwide. The platform enables game developers to manage their communities, livestream gameplay, and offer playable games directly to users through blockchain integration. Built with Next.js, Prisma database management, and Clarity smart contracts, StackVerse bridges traditional gaming experiences with Web3 capabilities to create a player-centric gaming environment.

> **ðŸŽ‰ Recently Migrated:** StackVerse has been successfully migrated from EVM to Stacks blockchain! See [MIGRATION_COMPLETE.md](./MIGRATION_COMPLETE.md) for details.

## 2. Market Need

### Current Industry Challenges

- **Exploitative Streaming Platforms**: Centralized platforms exploit streamers' hard work and community influence through unfair compensation practices, lacking transparency and consensus
- **Lack of Ownership**: Gamers invest significant time and money in games without receiving ownership, alignment, or governance
- **Missing GameFi Infrastructure**: Absence of proper infrastructure for crypto and NFT payouts in gaming streams
- **Outdated User Acquisition**: Web2 game publishers rely on paid ads and media rather than contribution-based approaches
- **Community Fragmentation**: Developers struggle to maintain cohesive communities across multiple platforms

## 3. Solution

StackVerse addresses these challenges by providing:

- **Interactive Gaming Platform**: Engaging platform for gamers built on the CoreDAO blockchain
