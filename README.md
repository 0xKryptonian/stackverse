## üèóÔ∏è Technical Architecture

### **Smart Contracts (Clarity)**

```
stacks-contracts/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ profile-nft.clar          # User identity NFTs
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ stackverse-token.clar     # SIP-010 fungible token
```

**Key Innovations:**
- **No reentrancy vulnerabilities** (Clarity language guarantee)
- **Built-in rate limiting** prevents token spam
- **Ownership verification** on all sensitive operations
- **Comprehensive input validation** across all functions

### **Frontend Stack**

```typescript
// Modern TypeScript with Stacks.js
- Next.js 14 (App Router)
- React 18 with TypeScript
- Stacks Connect for wallet integration
- Prisma for off-chain data management
- TailwindCSS + shadcn/ui components
- Livepeer for video streaming
```

**Integration Highlights:**
```typescript
// Seamless contract interaction
await createProfile(userSession, {
  name: "Player1",
  bio: "Pro gamer",
  socialLink: "twitter.com/player1",
  tokenUri: "ipfs://..."
});

// Token minting with rate limiting
await mintTokens(userSession, amount);

// Read-only queries
const balance = await getTokenBalance(address);
const profile = await getProfile(tokenId);
```

## üìä Technical Highlights

### **Clarity Smart Contract Features**

**Profile NFT Contract:**
```clarity
;; Ownership-verified profile updates
(define-public (update-profile (token-id uint) (name (string-ascii 50)) ...)
  (begin
    (asserts! (is-eq (some tx-sender) (nft-get-owner? profile-nft token-id))
      err-not-authorized)
    ;; Update logic
  )
)
```

**Token Contract with Rate Limiting:**
```clarity
;; Anti-spam minting mechanism
(define-public (mint (amount uint))
  (let ((blocks-passed (- stacks-block-height last-mint)))
    (asserts! (<= (+ amount current-minted) max-mint-per-day)
      err-daily-limit-exceeded)
    ;; Mint logic
  )
)
```

### **Frontend Integration**

// User-friendly transaction flow
await openContractCall({
  network: NETWORK,
  contractAddress: CONTRACT_ADDRESS,
  contractName: 'profile-nft',
